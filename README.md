The Arnold cat map is the most commonly used map in chaos-based image encryption


           Functions:
                Main function                  - main.m
                Arnold map function x-values   - arnoldx.m
                Arnold map function y-values   - arnoldy.m (Optional - If you need use y values)
              
             Arnold cat map is a chaotic map which is mainly used for the confusion of pixels.  
             The Arnold cat map is a transformation as per the following form :τ: (x,y)−→(2x+y,x+y)mod 1
             
             Input the value to x and y; The ranges starting from   
              x,y element of (0,1,2,.....N-1)
                 x=  ; %Initial values
                 y=  ; %Initial values
